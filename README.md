## HAPPY HOUR 
Powered by Google! This App uses both the GoogleMaps AND GooglePlaces APIs to showcase user verified Happy Hours on our map and allows you to search for and verify new bars as you visit them. Happy Hour â€” it's a team sport! 

### BACK END REPO!
As of August 2021 this Repo contains only the Rails backend code of the Happy Hour application. React frontend here --> https://github.com/zoeblairfriedman/happy-hour-frontend-v2

### Setup Rails Backend
    - Install the gems required by the application by running 'bundle install'
    - CD into the backend folder 'happy-hour-react-backend'
    - Migrate all tables and create the database by running 'rails db:migrate'
    - Seed the database by running 'rails db:seed'

### Start Backend Server
Start the server by running 'rails s'

### Works in progress:
You will notice that there is code here to accomodate the future addition of users, favorites bars and more! Stay tuned!

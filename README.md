HAPPY HOUR 

* CORS Extension
Currently you will need a CORS Changer extension to conduct necessary Google API searches. We recommend: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc

<!-- * // If people get their own API you need the Maps API AND the Places API enabled.  -->

* Setup Rails Backend
Install the gems required by the application by running 'bundle install'
CD into the backend folder 'happy-hour-react-backend'
Migrate all tables and create the database by running 'rails db:migrate'
Seed the database by running 'rails db:seed'

* Start Backend Server
Start the server by running 'rails s'

* Launch the front end 
Install all necessary packages by running 'npm install'

* Start Frontend Server
Start the server by running 'npm start'
You will likely need to type "Y" to run the frontend on a different server

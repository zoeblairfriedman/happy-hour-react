HAPPY HOUR REACT APP

* This is the Backend Only
As of August 2021 this Repo contains only the Back End code of the Happy Hour application. React Front End code here --> https://github.com/zoeblairfriedman/happy-hour-frontend-v2

* Terrible Practice*
As of now we are all sharing my API key. This is a terrible practice and is on my length ToDo list to remedy.

* Setup Rails Backend
Install the gems required by the application by running 'bundle install'
CD into the backend folder 'happy-hour-react-backend'
Migrate all tables and create the database by running 'rails db:migrate'
Seed the database by running 'rails db:seed'

* Start Backend Server
Start the server by running 'rails s'

* Works in progress:
You will notice that there is code here to accomodate the future addition of users, favorites bars and more! Stay tuned!
